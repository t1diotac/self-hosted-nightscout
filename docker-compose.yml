      ### Variables for the Nightscout container
      NODE_ENV: production

      ### Overridden variables for Docker Compose setup
      # The `nightscout` service can use HTTP, because we use `cloudflared` to serve the HTTPS
      # and manage TLS certificates
      INSECURE_USE_HTTP: 'true'

      # For all other settings, please refer to the Environment section of the README
      ### Required variables
      # MONGO_CONNECTION - The connection string for your Mongo database.
      # Something like mongodb://sally:sallypass@ds099999.mongolab.com:99999/nightscout
      # The default connects to the `mongo` included in this docker-compose file.
      # If you change it, you probably also want to comment out the entire `mongo` service block
      # and `depends_on` block above.
      MONGO_CONNECTION: mongodb://mongo:27017/nightscout

      # API_SECRET - A secret passphrase that must be at least 12 characters long.
      API_SECRET: ${NS_API_SECRET}

      # AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES (readable) - possible values readable, denied, or any valid role name.
      # When readable, anyone can view Nightscout without a token. Setting it to denied will require
      # a token from every visit, using status-only will enable api-secret based login.
      AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES: denied
