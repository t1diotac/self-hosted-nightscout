# self-hosted-nightscout

Files:
- README.md - This file
- docker-compose.yml - This is a modified docker-compose.yml originally obtained from "nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor" to replace traefik with cloudflared and some minor other changes.
- env-file - This is the .env file, rename to .env and make chanages specific to your setup and needs.
- Linux_VM-NightScout-Cloudflare-Podman-Install-Setup-Guide.odt - The guide. Ideally I should move this to the Wiki or to Markdown, but for now it's in Libre/OpenOffice ODT format.
